### ex00 = ft_print_program_name
Weâ€™re dealing with a program here, you should therefore have a function main in your .c file. Create a program that displays its own name followed by a new line.

### Command Line Arguments
The `main` function is always run when a program is run. Usually, `main` would be defined with the prototype `int main();`, compiled in shell with `cc filename.c`, and run with `./a.out`, however, `main` could also be defined with additional parameters, which would allow extra arguments to be passed when the program is run - this main prototype would look like: 
- `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`
	- `argc` is the Argument Count, the number of command-line arguments passed when the program was run, including itself (so if no additional arguments are given, `argc` is 1)
	- `arhv` is the Argument Vector, an array of pointers each pointing to one of the given arguments. `argv[0]` is a pointer to the name of the program. After that, `argv` is defined until `[argc-1]`.
		- `argv` could also be proceeded by two stars instead of the brackets: `**argv`.
		- `argv[argc]` is a NULL pointer
- When running the function in shell, extra arguments could be given as such - `$ ./a.out arg1 arg2`
	- Arguments can be surrounded by double or single quotes if they have spaces

### Code
```C
#include <unistd.h>
void	ft_putstr(char *str)
{
	int	str_index;

	str_index = 0;
	while (str[str_index] != '\0')
	{
		write(1, &str[str_index], 1);
		str_index++;
	}
}

int	main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	ft_putstr(argv[0])
}
```
