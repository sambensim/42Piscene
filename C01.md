# Project 4 - C01
### ex00 - ft_ft
Don't forget to turn spaces into tabs if using VSCode! (ctrl+a>ctrl+shift+p>"convert indents to tabs")
##### Problem
Create a function that takes a pointer to int as a parameter, and sets the value "42"
to that int.
> In other words - given a pointer to an int variable, change the int variable to 42
___
##### Pointers
A pointer is a variable that contains a memory address, usually for another variable
- `datatype *pointer_name;` declares a pointer (to a pseudo-random value)
- `pointer_name = &variable_name;` initializes a pointer to a variable's memory address (`&` before a variable name gives the memory address of that variable)
- `*pointer_name` accesses the value the pointer holds the memory address of (in this way, the address operator `&` is the reverse of `*`: `&` returns the memory address of a variable and `*` returns the value held in a memory address)
Pointers must be declared to the same datatype they will represent
___
##### Code
```C
void	ft_ft(int *nbr)
{
	*nbr = 42;
}
```
### ex01 - ft_ultimate_ft
##### Problem
Create a function that takes a pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer
to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to int as a parameter and sets the value
"42" to that int.
> In other words - given nine pointers to an int variable, change the int variable to 42
___
##### Pointers to Pointers
Pointers can also point to other pointers. To declare one such 'sub-pointer,' add an additional asterisk to its declaration - `datatype **pointer_to_pointer_name`. Access the pointer with the same number of asterisks before its name.
___
##### Code
```C
void	ft_ultimate_ft(int *********nbr)
{
	*********nbr = 42;
}
```
### ex02 - ft_swap
##### Problem
Create a function that swaps the value of two integers whose addresses are entered
as parameters.
> In other words - given two pointers to int variables, swap the values of the int variables
___
##### Code
```C
void	ft_swap(int *a, int *b)
{
	int	temp;

	temp = *a;
	*a = *b;
	*b = temp;
}
```
### ex03 - ft_div_mod
##### Problem
Create a function that divides parameter a by b and stores the result in the int pointed by
div. It also stores the remainder of the division of a by b in the int pointed by mod.
> In other words - given two ints a and b and two pointers to int variables div and mod, set div to the number of times b goes into a and mod to the remainder of a/b
___
##### Integer Division and Modulus
Because of the way C stores integers vs numbers with a decimal point (floating point numbers), variables of the integer type can never have a decimal. This means that when doing division with integers, C will always round down:
- 1/2=0
- 199/100=1
To get the remainder of this division, the modulo operation is used - represented in C as `%`:
- 1%2=1
- 199%100=99
___
##### Code
```C
void	ft_div_mod(int a, int b, int *div, int *mod)
{
	*div = a / b;
	*mod = a % b;
}
```
### ex04 - ft_ultimate_div_mod
##### Problem
Create a function that divides parameter a by b. The result of this division is stored in the
int pointed by a. The remainder of the division is stored in the int pointed by b.
> In other words - given pointers to int variables a and b, replace a with the number of times b goes into a and replace b with the remainder of a/b (this is the same as the last excercise but with different target variables)
___ 
##### Code
```C
void	ft_ultimate_div_mod(int *a, int *b)
{
	int	temp;

	temp = *a;
	*a = *a / *b;
	*b = temp / *b;
}
```
### ex05 - ft_putstr
##### Problem
Create a function that displays a string of characters on the standard output
> In other words - given the pointer to a character array (C's version of a string) variable, print the entire array/string
___
##### Strings in C and Char as a Boolean
Note that there is no 'string' data type in C. Instead, strings are stored as one-dimensional char arrays
- A variable meant to hold a string can be initialized with `char var_name[]`
- A value can be given to a string variable with `var_name[] = "text";`.
	- Optionally, the size of the array can be given in the assignment and/or declaration step: `char var_name[size] = "text";`
	- Strings take up a number of bytes equal to the number of chars in the array plus one - due to the need to end the string in `\0`, the null character (hence the term 'null-terminated string')
	- Strings can also be assigned a value one character at a time: `var_name[] = {'s','t','r','i','n,'g','\0'};`
		- Note here that the null character must be included in the assignment, this is automatically done if defining the string using double quotes
- A value can be accessed with `var_name[]` and an individual character can be accessed with `var_name[char_index]`

**There is no boolean data type**, in C, all integers and char indices are true as long as they are not zero (at the 0 index of characters is the null character `\0`)
	- Thus, `if (42)`, `if (-10)`, and `if ('a')` will always be true
___
##### Code
```C
void	ft_putstr(char *str)
{
	int	str_index;

	str_index = 0;
	while (str[str_index] != '\0')
	{
		write(1, str[str_index], 1);
		str_index++;
	}
}
```
### ex06 - ft_strlen
##### Problem
Create a function that counts and returns the number of characters in a string
> this is the same as ex05 but with a different output!
___
##### Code
```C
int	ft_strlen(char *str)
{
	int	str_index;

	str_index = 0;
	while (str[str_index])
	{
		str_index++;
	}
	return (str_index);
}
```
### ex07 - ft_rev_int_tab
##### Problem
Create a function which reverses a given array of integer (first goes last, etc). The arguments are a pointer to int and the number of ints in the array.
> In other words - given the pointer to an array of integers ('tab') and an integer representing the size of that array ('size'), reverse the order of the array (set tab to that value)
___
##### Code
```C
void	ft_rev_int_tab(int *tab, int size)
{
	int	index;
	int	temp;

	index = 0;
	while (index < size / 2)
	{
		temp = tab[size - (index) - 1];
		tab[size - (index) - 1] = tab[index];
		tab[index] = tab[size - (index) - 1];
		index++;
	}
}
```
### ex08 - ft_sort_int_tab
##### Problem
Create a function which sorts an array of integers by ascending order. The arguments are a pointer to int and the number of ints in the array.
> Time for BubbleSortâ„¢!
___
##### Code
```C
void	ft_sort_int_tab(int *tab, int size)
{
	int	sorted;
	int	index;
	int	temp;

	sorted = 0;
	index = 0;
	while (!sorted)
	{
		sorted = 1;
		while (index < size)
		{
			if (tab[index] > tab[index + 1])
			{
				temp = tab[index];
				tab[index] = tab[index + 1];
				tab[index + 1] = temp;
				sorted = 0;
			}
			index++;
		}
		index = 0;
	}
}

```
